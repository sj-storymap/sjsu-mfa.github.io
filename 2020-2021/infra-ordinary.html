          >“how are we to speak of these ‘common things’, how to track them down
          rather, how to flush them out, wrest them from the dross in which they
          remain mired, how to give them a meaning, a tongue, to let them,
          finally, speak of what is, of what we are. what’s needed perhaps is
          finally to found our own anthropology, one that will speak about us,
          will look in ourselves for what for so long we’ve been pillaging from
          others. not the exotic anymore, but the endotic. it matters little to
          me that these questions should be fragmentary, barely indicative of a
          method, at most of a project. it matters a lot to me that they should
          seem trivial and futile: that’s exactly what makes them just as
          essential, if not more so, as all the other questions by which we’ve
          tried in vain to lay hold on our truth.” georges perec, the

        (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
        the very unexpected circumstances of this past year created situations
        where we found ourselves having to negotiate what it means to turn
        inwards, physically and spatially, along with finding out the
        repercussions of this necessary act on our psyches. <br /><br />
        it is not new territory for artists. the act of turning the domestic and
        the interior life into medium and subject has been a constant in art
        making. artists as disparate as kurt schwitters, mark leckey, andrea
        zittel and carlo mollino have all used interiority as a way to create a
        personal mythology in their work. <br /><br />
        for the 2021 sjsu graduating mfa exhibition a thread of interiorities
        made itself instantly apparent. this grouping of artists all looked
        inward as a means to investigate their relationship with this very
        particular moment. a variety of approaches were surveyed by them,
        bringing about pictures of what making art work while being inside and
        isolated meant during this past year.

      <h3>
        looking out the window:
      </h3>
      <p>
        when faced with confinement the immediate instinct is to look outside.
        windows serve to create a continuum between the spaces we inhabit and
        the promise of possibility in what is out there. <br /><br />
        <i>sashiko</i>, the work of kyoko fisher, allows her to create a
        timeline between past and present through the formal relationships of
        shapes and lines. she makes use of her observations acquired while
        studying japanese history and culture, particularly with an eye on
        mingei – or art objects made by ordinary people during the edo period.
        the artist utilizes an intrinsicate process of etching prints with sewn
        sashiko (a form of decorative reinforcement stitching on traditional
        japanese clothing). the technique employed by her is a means to achieve
        connection with the timeline of her personal narrative, while anchoring
        it in a contemporary perspective.
      </p>
      <h3>
        bringing the window to the kitchen wall:
      </h3>
      <p>
        alana rios’ series <i>the calendar project</i>, speculates on the
        possibilities of an outdoors rendered flat. through photographing an
        ansel adams photo calendar of national parks placed on her domestic
        walls, the artist creates a definite tension between the outside and
        inside in a variety of ways.the calendars are filled with personal notes
        while depicting a very public environment. the 20th century classic
        cannon of landscape photography from the calendar is reframed by shadows
        created from light hitting surfaces in her surroundings, as well by the
        contemporaneity of the artists’ conceptual intentions.
      </p>
      <h3>
        i’m sitting in a room:
      </h3>
      <p>
        alvin lucier’s seminal sound art piece, <i>i am sitting in a room</i>,
        explores the degradation of resonance encountered in a room when the
        same recording is played and re-recorded over and over to the point of
        unintelligibility. it becomes a sound portrait of the space achieved by
        means of repetitive translation. <br /><br />
        in thinking about ways where repetition and rendering are used as formal
        strategies, omar farid harb, paints portraits of his domestic spaces,
        finding in them new textures and dimensions to bring forth onto the
        canvas. objects, rooms and people are focused upon and re-arranged. they
        become the main characters of a narrative filtered through languid
        brushstrokes. the visual translation that develops from these
        negotiations with his surroundings, shows the unfolding of a personal
        lens expressing both a familiarity alongside an unexpected strangeness,
        which cohabit in these paintings. <br /><br />
        monica valdez’ drawings show textures becoming building blocks for a
        personal architecture made by conglomerating shapes of everyday objects
        and turning them into imagined ones. the drawings take on a sculptural
        quality to bring forth the possibility of a phantasmagoric, alternate
        realm where such artifacts would exist. <br /><br />
        <i>i’ll remember this moment forever</i> is the body of work lacey nein
        created while spending the past year occupied with all the minutiae (and
        grandiosity) that having a newborn entails. her sculptures made out of
        the muslim cloth used to swaddle her child, integrate prints portraying
        moments of her past year’s experience as a first-time mother. given the
        isolated conditions we were all experiencing during this time, these
        were moments only witnessed by her. the pieces work as a register or
        mementos of these private happenings
      </p>
      <h3>
        fantastic architectures:
      </h3>
      <p>
        wolf vostell and dick higgings edited a book, first published in 1969,
        where they included works by artists utilizing architectural
        extrapolations. at the time they felt architecture was not moving along
        with the revolutions happening in the culture. they thought the artists
        featured in the book, were utilizing the language and form of
        architecture but imagining new ways needed for it to have a dialogue
        with the socio-cultural needs of that time. <br /><br />
        through researching other disciplines that inform their work, artists
        will often take liberties that can result into new methodologies
        pertinent to moving a canon forward. <br /><br />
        megan moriarty’s exploration of interiority delves into microscopic
        levels making visible hidden biological landscapes. utilizing
        experiments with space, light and sound she brings forth a visualization
        that shares territory with philosophy, art and science in their quest to
        manifest the unexplainable. moriarti’s technique echoes arcane methods
        such as wabi sabi, alchemy and scientific photography. she creates
        abstract, fractal patterns to bring forth the unseen surfaces that
        surrounds us.
      </p>
      <h3>
        (e)inter-immensity:
      </h3>
      <p>
        a chapter in gaston bachelard’s <i>the poetics of space</i> regarding
        interior immensities, may have not been conceived with the digital realm
        in mind. however, it is not a stretch to consider it as an adequate lens
        for surveying contemporary inner locales. in that chapter, Bachelard
        suggests that “since immense is not an object, a phenomenology of
        immense would refer us directly to our imagining consciousness”.
        <br /><br />
        kiki wu’s digital art project, <i>the release</i>, proposes delving into
        such immensities and imaginings. exploring human traditions related to
        death, the irl realm is transposed to the virtual realm. in many
        cultures funerary objects and offerings to the dead are part of the
        rituals surrounding death. participants in this project, are asked to
        share a personal object to the virtual space of the project. these
        objects are turned into 3d files that become a nft and take part of an
        online exhibition extending the spiritual body and intention into the
        digital space.<br /><br />
